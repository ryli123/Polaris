# Polaris
Polaris is designed as a Rudimentary Spacecraft Guidance System (RSGS) that uses three single-gimbal gyroscopes to detect the orientation of a spacecraft in three axes of freedom. The project is coded in Java and C++/Arduino; the RSGS Arduino communicates with the controller through an HC-05 Bluetooth module. A Java GUI displays updated information on orientation through numerical and visual means, which is logged in Excel and can be accessed post-flight.
